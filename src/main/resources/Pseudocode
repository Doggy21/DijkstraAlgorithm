init model.Graph
declare start and end nodes
declare a list of distance to all nodes
declare a list of unvisited nodes
declare a map with shortest paths to all nodes: map(pathToNode, List<All nodes from start to this>)
mark visited the start node

while i have unvisited nodes
    check distance to adjacent nodes of all visited nodes
    if distance to node is not set, update with first value
    if distance is already set, we don't update, we update only new nodes (total distance is the sum of shortest path to that node and last edge)
    if an unvisited node is adjacent to multiple nodes, choose the shortest path/length from all possibilities
    move to closest(currently known) unvisited node
    mark node visited (remove from unvisited list)
    add to path
